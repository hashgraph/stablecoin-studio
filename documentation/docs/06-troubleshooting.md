# 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### 1. "Invalid Private Key" 🔑
Check if you used the **Hex** key from the portal. The SDK will reject DER keys.

### 2. "Token Not Associated" 🤝
The recipient account MUST associate with the Token ID before you can transfer funds to them.

### 3. Docker Errors 🐋
If the Mirror Node fails, ensure ports **5432** (DB) and **8080** (API) are free.
