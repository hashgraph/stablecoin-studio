# Overview
Implementation of a group of tools composed by a CLI, SDK, UI and SmartContracts that facilitates the implementation and deployment of Stable Coins and their management.

# Project structure

There are 4 modules:
````
  /cli            
  /contracts    
  /sdk          
  /web          
````

- **`/cli`:** A CLI tool for Node to manage and operate on stable coins.
- **`/contracts`:** The solidity smart contracts on which the stable coins are based on.
- **`/sdk`:** The SDK that implements the features to manage and operate stable coins.
- **`/web`:** A DAPP developed with React to manage and operate on stable coins.

# Installing

In a terminal:

````
npm install
````
This will install the dependencies in all projects and setup the links between them.

You can now start developing on any of the modules.

# Building
When making modifications to any of the modules, you have to re-compile the dependencies, in this order, depending on which ones the modifications where made:
````bash
  // 1st
  $ npm run build:contracts
  // 2nd
  $ npm run build:sdk
  // 3rd
  $ npm run build:cli
  // or
  $ npm run build:web
````

Or within any of the modules:
````bash
  $ cd [module] // sdk, web, contracts, etc
  $ npm run build
````


# Typescript

Typescript 4.7 or higher is highly reccomended to work with the repositories.
