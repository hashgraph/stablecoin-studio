# Overview

This module contains the solidity smart contracts used in the Hedera stablecoin project.

The Hedera Token Service (HTS) functionality required in this project is exposed through an `HTS precompiled smart contract` implemented, deployed and managed by Hedera.

The smart contracts located in the `hts-precompile` folder are used to interact with the _HTS precompiled smart contract_ mentioned above, and have also been implemented and provided by Hedera. For more information about these contracts check the [Hedera Service Solidity Library](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks/smart-contracts/hedera-service-solidity-libraries) and the [Hedera hts precompiled contracts gitHub repository](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-smart-contracts/tree/main/contracts/hts-precompile):

- `HederaRespondeCodes.sol`: Contains the list of response codes the _HTS precompiled smart contract_ methods return.
- `IHederaTokenService.sol`: Interface implemented by the _HTS precompiled smart contract_. In order to execute an HTS operation, our smart contracts will need to instantiate this interface with the _HTS precompiled smart contract_ address.

The remaining smart contracts have been implemented for this project:
- Contracts within the `extensions` folder: _one contract for each stablecoin operation_.
  - `BurnableFacet.sol`: implements the _burn_ operation (burns tokens from the treasury account. Decreases the total supply).
  - `CashInFacet.sol`: implements the _cash-in_ operation (mints new tokens and transfers them to an account. Increases the total supply).
  - `DeletableFacet.sol`: implements the _delete_ operation (deletes the stablecoin's underlying token).  
    **WARNING**: THIS OPERATION CANNOT BE ROLLED BACK. A stablecoin WITHOUT AN UNDERLYING TOKEN WILL NOT WORK ANYMORE.
  - `FreezableFacet.sol`: implements the _freeze_ and _unfreeze_ operations (if the token is frozen for an account, this account will not be able to operate with the stablecoin until unfrozen).
  - `KYCFacet.sol`: implements the _grantKyc_ and _revokeKyc_ operations to grant or revoke the KYC flag to a Hedera account for the stablecoin.
  - `PausableFacet.sol`: implements the _pause_ and _unpause_ operations (if a token is paused, no one will be able to operate with it until unpaused).
  - `RescatableFacet.sol`: implements the _rescue_ and _rescueHBAR_ operations (transfers tokens and HBAR, respectively, from the treasury accountâ€”being the stablecoinâ€™s smart contractâ€”to another account).
  - `ReserveFacet.sol`: implements the reserve logic for the stablecoin (checks against the current reserve before minting, allows updating the reserve data feed, etc.).  
    The reserve address can be set to `0.0.0` (zero address) to disable the reserve mechanism.
  - `RoleManagementFacet.sol`: implements the _grantRoles_ and _revokeRoles_ operations (grants and revokes multiple roles to/from multiple accounts in a single transaction).
  - `RolesFacet.sol`: contains the definition of the roles that can be assigned to each stablecoin.
  - `SupplierAdminFacet.sol`: implements the management of the _cash-in_ role (assigning/removing the role and setting, increasing, or decreasing the cash-in limit).
  - `TokenOwnerFacet.sol`: stores the addresses of the _HTS precompiled smart contract_ and the _underlying token_ related to the stablecoin. All other facets rely on this.
  - `WipeableFacet.sol`: implements the _wipe_ operation (burns tokens from any account. Decreases the total supply).
  - `HoldManagementFacet.sol`: implements the _hold_ functionality, enabling temporary locking of tokens under the control of an escrow address. This is used in scenarios like secondary market trades or regulatory compliance.
- Important contracts within the `resolver` folder:
  - `BusinessLogicResolver.sol`: central contract that maps function selectors to facet addresses. All stablecoin proxies delegate the selector resolution to this resolver, enabling centralized upgradeability across all stablecoins.
  - `ResolverProxy.sol`: lightweight diamond clone that delegates execution to the correct facet based on the mapping returned by the `BusinessLogicResolver`.
  - `BusinessLogicResolverWrapper.sol`: helper contract to simplify interaction with the resolver.

- `HederaReserveFacet.sol`: implements the ChainLink AggregatorV3Interface to provide the current data about the stablecoin's reserve.
- `HederaTokenManagerFacet.sol`: defines the main logic to initialize and manage a stablecoin. It exposes key ERC-20-like read functions (`name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`) and supports on-chain metadata and token updates via HTS.
- `StableCoinFactoryFacet.sol`: implements the flow to create a new stablecoin. Every time a new stablecoin is created, several smart contracts must be deployed and initialized and an underlying token must be created through the `HTS precompiled smart contract`. this multi-transaction process is encapsulated in this contract so that users can create new stablecoins in a single transaction. **IMPORTANT** : a factory contract will be deployed in tesnet for anybody to use. Users are also free to deploy and use their own factory contract.
- These last three contracts have their own interfaces in the `Interfaces` folder.

> ðŸ’¡ Each stablecoin is deployed as a diamond clone (via `ResolverProxy`) and uses a shared `BusinessLogicResolver` to dynamically delegate logic calls. This enables centralized logic upgrades across all stablecoins with a single transaction.

# Content

These are the folders and files you can find in this project:

- `contracts`: The folder with the solidity files. Inside this folder you can also find the _hts-precompile_ and the _extensions_ folders, including this last one an interface folder, presented in the **[Overview](#Overview)** section.
- `docs`: Detailed documentation for each smart contract in the "contracts" folder.
- `scripts`: Typescript files used to create new stablecoins and deploy required smart contracts. These files are used when testing.
- `test`: Typescript tests files.
- `typechain-types`: the most important thing in this folder are contract factories which are used not only for testing, but also by any other project importing the stablecoin solution. The content of this folder is autogenerated by `hardhat-abi-exporter` plugin whenever the user compiles the contracts.
- `.env`: environment file used in tests execution.
- `.eslintrc.json`: ESLint tool configuration file for linting JavaScript code.
- `.solhint.json`: Solhint tool configuration file for linting solidity code.
- `hardhat.SignatureServiceConfig.ts`: hardhat configuration file.
- `package.json`: Node project configuration file.
- `prettier.config.js`: several languages code formatter configuration file.
- `README.md`
- `Slither`: folder containing everything related to the slither analysis.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
- `tslint.json`: TSLint tool configuration file for linting TypeScript code.

# Technologies

The IDE we use in this project is **Hardhat**, in order to use it you must have:

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/docs)
- [node (version 16)](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

The smart contract programming language is **Solidity** version 0.8.16.

# Build

First download and install the project dependencies :

1. Run `cd contracts`. This will change your current working directory to the `contracts` folder.
2. Run `npm install`. This will create and populate `node_modules`.

Then compile and build the contracts, you can choose one of the following options:

1. Run `npm run compile` to compile the contracts that were modified after the last compilation (This will NOT build the package, you need to run step 3)
2. Run `npm run compile:force` to compile all the contracts (even those that were not modified after the last compilation) and build the package (you can skip step 3).
3. run `npm run build` to build the package without compiling the contracts.

The first two commands will generate a `build` folder that contains a `typechain-types` folder. This folder contains the contracts wrappers that allows us to access contracts abi importing the wrappers as shown below:

```code
import { hederaTokenManager__factory } from '@hashgraph/stablecoin-npm-contracts/typechain-types';
```

# Test

Each test follows the _arrange, act, assert_ pattern and is self-contained, ensuring full independence and allowing them to run in parallel and in any order.
Typescript test files are located in the `test` folder and are organized into two parallel execution threads:
- `Thread0/`
- `Thread1/`

## Configuration

### Test accounts

You need to create the `.env` file cloning the content of `.env.sample` and add **two Hedera accounts** that will be used for testing.

These accounts must be existing valid accounts in the **Hedera network** you are using to test the smart contracts, they must also have a **positive balance large enough** to run all the contract deployments, invocations and token creations executed in the tests.

For each account you must provide the Private Key (7647657eerr65....878)

Example for the Hedera testnet (_fake data_):

```.env
    # * Accounts and Keys
    # Private keys in RAW Format (Not DER)
    # local
    LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY_0='0xEXAMPLEPRIVATEKEY0'
    LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY_1='0xEXAMPLEPRIVATEKEY1'
    # testnet
    TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY_0='0xEXAMPLEPRIVATEKEY4'
    TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY_1='0xEXAMPLEPRIVATEKEY5'
    # ... add more keys as needed
    
```

#### Operating accounts

All tests will use the two above mentioned accounts.

- `Operator Account (PRIVATE_KEY_0)`: This is the account that will deploy the stablecoin used for testing. It will have full rights.
- `Non Operator Account (PRIVATE_KEY_1)`: This is the account that will NOT deploy the stablecoin used for testing. It will have no rights to the stablecoin unless explicitly granted during the test.


## Run tests
This project includes a suite of automated tests to validate stablecoin functionality. You can run all tests at once, in parallel, or focus on a specific test file.

### Run all test (Default):
Run all test files using the default configuration:
```bash
npm run test
```

### Run tests in parallel:
To speed up the process, you can run all tests concurrently:

```bash
npm run test:parallel
```
> Useful for CI environments or large test suites.

### Run specific test:
You can also run a single test file. For example, to run only the KYC-related tests:
```bash
npm run test:kyc
```
> You can customize this command or create more aliases in package.json as needed.

# Deploy 
## Deploy full infrastructure

To deploy the entire infrastructure required to support stablecoins, including all core facets, the factory, and the business logic resolver, use the provided programmatic setup via Hardhat.

This includes:

- All diamond facets (KYC, Hold, Burnable, CustomFees, etc.). 
- The BusinessLogicResolver, initialized and registered. 
- Creation of configurations (versioned logic definitions). 
- Deployment of a ResolverProxy for the StableCoinFactory.

```shell
npx hardhat deployInfrastructure --network <network>
```

### What Does This Do?
This deployment process:

1. Deploys All Contracts: Includes facets such as HederaTokenManagerFacet, ReserveFacet, KYCFacet, and others using the appropriate deploy factories. 
2. Initializes BusinessLogicResolver: Prepares it to manage logic configuration versions.
3. Registers All Deployed Facets:Links the logic into the resolver to enable version control and upgrades.
4. Creates Configurations: Assigns configuration IDs and versions to each facet (for StableCoin, Reserve, Factory, etc.).
5. Deploys ResolverProxy for Factory :Binds the StableCoinFactory logic to a proxy, managed by the resolver.
6. Saves Environment (optional):If the --useEnvironment flag is passed, deployment metadata is stored in the project's Environment.ts for reusability in later tasks.

### Optional flags
| Flag                   | Description                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--useDeployed`        | Reuse already deployed contracts if addresses are known. |
| `--useEnvironment`     | Load or save config using `Environment.ts`.              |
| `--partialBatchDeploy` | Enables partial config creation logic per token type.    |


## Deploy a new Stablecoin
The deployment of a stablecoin is managed through a custom Hardhat task: deployStableCoin. This command interacts with the StableCoinFactory and BusinessLogicResolver to initialize and deploy a fully functional stablecoin with optional metadata, roles, reserve configuration, and KYC settings.

```shell
npx hardhat deployStableCoin \
--businessLogicResolverProxyAddress <resolverProxy> \
--stableCoinFactoryProxyAddress <factoryProxy> \
--network <network>
```
### Minimun required parameters
| Parameter                             | Description                                         |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `--businessLogicResolverProxyAddress` | Address of the deployed BusinessLogicResolver proxy |
| `--stableCoinFactoryProxyAddress`     | Address of the deployed StableCoinFactory proxy     |
| `--network`                           | Network where deploy the SC                         |

> Note: If --useEnvironment is passed, many of the required addresses and defaults will be pulled from the internal Environment.ts.

### Example
```shell
npx hardhat deployStableCoin \
  --tokenName "USD Token" \
  --tokenSymbol "USDT" \
  --tokenDecimals 6 \
  --tokenInitialSupply 1000000 \
  --tokenMaxSupply 10000000 \
  --createReserve true \
  --addKyc true \
  --grantKYCToOriginalSender true \
  --stableCoinConfigurationIdKey "" \
  --stableCoinConfigurationIdVersion 1 \
  --businessLogicResolverProxyAddress 0x123...abc \
  --stableCoinFactoryProxyAddress 0x456...def \
  --network testnet
```

## Upgrade Logic (via BusinessLogicResolver)
This system uses a modular Diamond + Resolver pattern for managing upgradeable logic. Smart contracts delegate calls through a ResolverProxy, which dynamically fetches the latest logic version for a given component (e.g., stablecoin, reserve) from a centralized BusinessLogicResolver.

### How it works?
The BusinessLogicResolver:

- Maps configuration keys (like stableCoin, reserve, factory) to facet contract addresses. 
- Tracks versioned logic by assigning each registered contract a role in the system (defined by selectors and interfaces). 
- Allows updating logic without redeploying proxies, by using version-aware resolver lookups.

### Register new logic version
To register a new list of logic contracts (facets) for any configuration key, use the following Hardhat task:

```shell
npx hardhat updateBusinessLogicKeys \
  --resolverAddress <businessLogicResolverAddress> \
  --implementationAddressList <commaSeparatedFacetAddresses> \
  --privateKey <yourPrivateKey> \
  --network <network>

```
#### Required parameters:
| Flag                          | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--resolverAddress`           | Address of the `BusinessLogicResolver` contract                    |
| `--implementationAddressList` | Comma-separated list of facet contract addresses                   |
| `--privateKey`                | Private key of the account with permissions to update the resolver |
| `--network`                   | Hardhat network to use                                             |

### When to use this?

Use this approach whenever:
- You deploy new or upgraded logic contracts (facets).
- You want the resolver to expose new logic for proxies using ResolverProxy.
- Youâ€™re rotating logic or deploying stablecoins with a new configuration.

>For this to work, the BusinessLogicResolver must be initialized. If it's not yet initialized, use the initializeBusinessLogicResolver task first.

# V1 to V2 Migration
In order to migrate V1 Stablecoins to V2 you need to :

- Enter the private key of the account set as `owner` in your Stablecoin's `Proxy admin` in the `MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY_0` field of the `.env`file.
- Then run the following hardhat task: 

```shell
npx hardhat migrateStableCoinToV2 --stablecoinconfigurationidkey CONFIG_ID --stablecoinconfigurationidversion CONFIG_VERSION --businesslogicresolverproxyaddress BLR --stablecoinaddress SC_PROXY --stablecoinproxyadminaddress SC_PROXY_ADMIN
```

Where

    - CONFIG_ID: config id of the stablecoin  (bytes32)
    - CONFIG_VERSION: config version of the stablecoin (integer)
    - BLR: Business logic resolver address (evm address)
    - SC_PROXY: address of the stablecoin's proxy (evm address)
    - SC_PROXY_ADMIN: address of the stablecoin's admin proxy (evm address)
