///
///			All registered Business Logics must have the same number of versions, so that they have a common "latest"
///			version and any previous version can be resolved for any existing Business Logic no matter when it was
///			added to the register.
///         The idea is that consumers should use Business Logics belonging to the same version since those are
/// 		considered fully compatible.
///			Registering a business logic (register = update its latest version or add it to the registry) will increase the
///			latest version for all Business Logics by 1.
